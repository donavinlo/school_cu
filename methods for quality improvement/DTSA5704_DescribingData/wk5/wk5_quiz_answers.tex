\#Q14,15,16: Question 14 One of the many consumable supplies that a
company's Purchasing Department is responsible for obtaining is cutter
inserts for their lathe operations. The purchasing manager previously
elected to buy an equal volume of cutters from two suppliers. The lathe
operators, through time, had been reporting to their department
supervisor that there was a difference between the two vendors' cutter
inserts in terms of cutting life. The supervisor decided to
statistically test whether there was really a difference in the average
cutting life between the two vendors' inserts. She requested that her
operators use the inserts fromthe two suppliers in a random fashion
across the parts being machined and to record the total cutting time
(life) for each of the inserts.

When sufficient data were compiled, the supervisor organized the
obtained values as shown below, and saved them in a file named
TOOLLIFE.DAT. The insert life was recorded in minutes. Assist the
supervisor in conducting the appropriate analysis required to answer the
research question

-Which Vendor has the higher mean? - Vendor 1 - Which Vendor has the
higher variance? - Vendor 2 - Means

Question 18 A steel bar straightening machine has been in use for 15
years. When the machine was purchased (prior to the implementation of
quality improvement policies), it was assumed that it would perform as
advertised. That is, it would significantly improve the straightness of
the product. The process engineer had just recently attended a stats
course in R. They became anxious to statistically test whether the
straightening operation was changing the process mean for bar
straightness.

20 bars were randomly selected from a production lot and identified in a
serial fashion. It was then arranged to have an inspector measure the
straightness of each bar. Subsequently, the bars were put through the
straightening operation. Each of the bars was remeasured for
straightness after the operation by the same inspector.

Because the measurements were repeated on the same parts and the data
were paired according to the bar identification, we have data that are
dependent by nature. The first column contains the straightness values
measured prior to the operation and the second column contains the
values measured after the operation. The values in each row represent
the same specimen, in this case, a bar. A flat bar has a value of zero,
a non-flat bar has values above zero. The data file is named
Straight.dat.

Has the straightening operation significantly changed the process mean?
Has the straightness of the population of bars been improved? Assume an
‚ç∫ of 0.010.

\#Q20\_21\_22

A plant superintendent has been assigned the task of improving the joint
strength of a clutch assembly. The assembly consists of two components:
the clutch cup and the drive sprocket. The two components are joined
together by means of a brazing operation.

The plant superintendent wanted to investigate whether changing the
brazing material would affect average braze strength. They decided he
would braze one group with pure copper wire and braze another group with
the existing copper alloy. One of the two components, the sprocket, is
manufactured from powdered metal.

The superintendent had observed from past studies that there was a
strong relationship between the density of the sprocket and the joint
strength of the assembly after brazing. The greater the porosity of the
powdered metal sprocket, the more absorption of the braze material takes
place, resulting in a weaker bond.

They decided to use the known relationship between sprocket porosity and
joint strength for setting up a matched-pairs design. 100 sprockets were
randomly selected from inventory and identified and measured for
density. They were then rank ordered from lowest to highest and paired
according to their density. Each pair of sprockets was randomly assigned
to one of two groups that were to receive the different brazing
material.

Once the random assignments were completed, the superintendent verified
that there was no statistically significant difference between the two
groups for density in terms of central tendency and dispersion.

The two groups were then run in pairs through the braze furnace. The
braze strength of the assemblies was tested to failure in the laboratory
on an Instron machine. The superintendent calculated the following
statistics:

A process engineer arranged to measure the out-of-flatness
characteristic after the heat and quench operation on 20 randomly
selected units. The components were then stress relieved with a typical
production lot. The same 20 units were re-measured for out of flatness
after tempering.

The recorded data are stored in a data file called Temper.dat. Zero
indicates no warp. A value greater than zero indicates the presence of
warp. Use the appropriate hypothesis test to determine whether the
fixture and the stress relief operation have effectively reduced
out-of-flatness (on the average and variance). Be sure you make an
iso-plot as part of your analysis. Assume a significance level of 0.05.

\#30 - yes, an improvement has been made \# Q31,32, 33

In order to meet volume requirements, two injection molding machines are
used to produce the same connector housing. There are several visual
characteristics that are identified as critical to the customer.

The plant manager has requested that the department supervisor determine
if the nonconforming rate of all combined visual characteristics is
different for the two machines. Note that a product is nonconforming if
one or more nonconformities are found on the product.

Two random samples of 500 units each were selected from the production
output from each machine. The parts were visually inspected and yielded
the following results.

p1 = 0.054 p2 = 0.036

The characteristic ``shiny finish'' on coated plastic cosmetic
containers has been established as a critical characteristic for
customers. One manufacturer of these products has incorporated an extra
operation known as ``buffing where applicable'' to insure itself of
meeting this customer expectation. Some of the components have a
metallic chrome finish. The company has assumed that the buffing
operation, which follows the chroming operation, naturally improves the
shiny appearance of the surface.

One employee wanted to statistically test this assumption and was given
permission by management to do so. They randomly selected 150 cosmetic
bases from production after the chroming operation and performed the
visual inspection procedures for judging acceptable and unacceptable
shininess. They carefully numbered each of the parts before visually
inspecting them in random order. They then arranged to have the parts
buffed with regular production units. The parts were retrieved and they
visually inspected them in the appropriate manner a second time. They
then arranged the results in matched fashion as shown in the table
below. Use the appropriate test and procedures to help them report the
appropriate findings to management. Assume Œ± = 0.05.

Question 37 Safety data have been collected in a manufacturing plant for
the past several years. During an initial time period of 2 years, 15
lost-time accidents occurred. A safety improvement program was then
instituted.

During the next 1 year, 10 lost-time accidents occurred. Has the safety
initiative resulted in an improvement in the safety level in the plant
as measured by the lost-time accident rate?.

You may assume the data were tested and conform to a Poisson
distribution. Use a Confidence Level of 95\%.
